## drawing_of_cliques and coordinates_generator

Programs for checking fingerprints of complete graphs and also generating coordinates representing the drawings determined by these fingerprints writen in C++; see documentation.html included in both of the folders. To understand the ideas you can read Chapter 3 of thesis.tex in Bachelor thesis.zip

## VisulaizerWPF and ConjectureChecker

Programs to visualize the drawings and to check conjecture stated at the end of Chapter 3 of thesis.tex in Bachelor thesis.zip; see Chapter 4 of thesis.tex in Bachelor thesis.zip for User's guide.

## Data

Most of the files with realizable fingerprints can be found in data/ folders of drawings_of_cliques and coordinates_generator and most of the files with coordinates to vizualize can be found in data/ folders of VizualizerWPF. The files that exceed 100MB and are already generated - as all realizable fingerprints for complete graphs on eight vertices can be found [here](https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~fila/bachelor_thesis.html).
