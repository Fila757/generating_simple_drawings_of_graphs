## drawing_of_cliques and coordinates_generator

Programs for checking fingerprints of complete graphs and generating coordinates representing the drawings determined by these fingerprints written in C++ and supposed to be run on Linux; see documentation.html included in both folders. To understand the ideas, you can read Chapter 3 of the thesis.tex in Bachelor thesis.zip. It is also needed to install boost library for coordinates generator and google tests for testing in Tests folder.

## VisulaizerWPF and ConjectureChecker

Programs to visualize the drawings and to check conjecture stated at the end of Chapter 3 of thesis.tex in Bachelor thesis.zip; see Chapter 4 of thesis.tex in Bachelor thesis.zip for User's guide. The visualizer and conjecturechecker are designed for Windows. In order to run the visualizer, you need to install two NuGets - MaterialDesignThemes and ShowMeTheXAML.

## Data

Most of the files with realizable fingerprints can be found in data/ folders of drawings_of_cliques and coordinates_generator and most of the files with coordinates to vizualize can be found in data/ folders of VizualizerWPF. The files that exceed 100MB and are already generated - as all realizable fingerprints for complete graphs on eight vertices can be found [here](https://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~fila/bachelor_thesis.html).
